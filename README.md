## VS code installation on the VM

You can skip this part but this is simply to have a vscode available for this course.

Please make sure to follow the instructions below: 

1. Fork this repo into your own account
2. Clone the repo on your local machin or your VM
3. Enter the cloned repository: `cd <the-forked-repo>``
4. Update the `.env` file with your VM Ip address :

```sh
VM_IP=34.240.199.59 # change this
WORKSPACE_DIR=./prefect
```
5. Run the command : `make setup`
This command will download and build everything you for you. It can take a couple of minutes. To have the status of the installation, you can use the command `docker logs <container ID>` (you can get the container `lscr.io/linuxserver/code-server` id with the command `docker ps`.)

Wait until you see :

```sh
